## Gameplay roadmap (updated Apr 2023)

_Adaptory_ is being designed as a base-builder with dozens of individual systems, all interacting together in novel and emergent ways.
The plan is to regularly release updates showing off each new system,
but I'm only a single developer at the moment so they'll take time to do well! ðŸ˜…

**This is not an exhaustive list** and may be changed at any time.
Some systems might not be fun, or we might get new ideas!
